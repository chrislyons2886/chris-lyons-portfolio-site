# chris-lyons-portfolio-site

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to create an attractive portfolio site selling myself and my skillset to potential employers. The site features a brief "About Chris" section, a "Chris' Work" section that highlights recent projects, and a "Contact Chris" area that allows prospective users to contact me.  The site was built using CSS responsive design techniques, CSS variables, and flexbox.
